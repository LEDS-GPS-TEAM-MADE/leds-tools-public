# Project Communication Plan

This communication plan defines the official communication channels, their purposes, owners, and frequency of use. The goal is to ensure alignment, transparency, and agility in the information flow among all project stakeholders.

##  Communication Channels

| Channel         | Purpose                                                            | Owner                          | Frequency                    |

| **WhatsApp**    | Emergency messages, quick alerts                                   | All team members               | As needed                    |


##  Communication Best Practices

- Use **Discord** as the main channel for day-to-day communication.
- Avoid redundant messages across **WhatsApp** and **Discord**.
- Schedule meetings in the shared team calendar.
- Maintain a **shared folder** for documentation, meeting notes, and key files.

## Review

The communication plan will be reviewed at the end of each sprint or whenever the team structure or processes change.
